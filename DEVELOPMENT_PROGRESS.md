# Development Progress Summary

This document summarizes the development work performed to address issues and improve the codebase.

## 1. Initial Problem: Blank Webpage

The primary issue reported was a completely black webpage when booting the project. This was traced to a JavaScript runtime error in the frontend.

## 2. Frontend Fixes

### 2.1. Blank Screen / `k is undefined` Error

- **Issue:** The webpage was black, and the browser console showed `Uncaught TypeError: k is undefined` (minified) or `Uncaught TypeError: react_production_min is undefined` (unminified). This indicated a problem with React module loading.
- **Root Cause:** The `vite.config.ts` file had a `manualChunks` configuration that was causing incorrect dependency resolution between JavaScript chunks, leading to React not being loaded correctly.
- **Resolution:**
    - Removed the `manualChunks` configuration from `frontend/vite.config.ts`. This allows Vite to use its default, more robust chunking strategy.
    - Performed a clean build of the frontend (`npm install` and `npm run build`) to ensure fresh bundles were generated.
    - Restarted the Nginx container serving the frontend to ensure the new bundles were served.

### 2.2. Linting and Code Quality Improvements

Several linting errors and warnings were identified and fixed to improve code quality and maintainability.

- **`frontend/src/components/ImprovedDashboardLayout.tsx`:**
    - Removed unused `programId` parameters from `handlePauseProgram` and `handleStopProgram`.
    - Added `calculateGridColumns` to the `useEffect` dependency array to resolve a missing dependency warning.
- **`frontend/src/components/TimeSeriesDataGraph.tsx`:**
    - Removed unused import `getDataSourceById`.
    - Replaced `Record<string, any>` with a more specific `ChartPoint` type to improve type safety.
- **`frontend/src/components/panels/TimeSeriesPanel.tsx`:**
    - Replaced `any[]` with `SensorData[]` for the `data` prop to improve type safety.
- **`frontend/src/hooks/useMachineProgram.ts`:**
    - Removed unused `programId` parameters from `onPauseProgram`, `onStopProgram`, and `onResumeProgram`.
- **`frontend/src/pages/MachineDetailPage.tsx`:**
    - Removed unused imports `Machine` and `SensorData`.
- **`frontend/src/services/dncHub.ts`:**
    - Removed unused `deviceId` from the `destroy` function.
    - Renamed unused `e` to `error` in `destroy` and `notifyListeners` functions for clarity.
- **`frontend/src/store/dncStore.ts`:**
    - Removed unused imports `mapDncStateToStatus`, `ProgressEvent`, and `ProgressCanonical`.
- **`frontend/src/store/machineStore.ts`:**
    - Removed unused `removedStatus` and `removedData` variables in the `deleteMachine` function.

### 2.3. API Service and State Management Enhancements

- **`frontend/src/services/apiService.ts`:**
    - Removed `console.log` statements from request and response interceptors.
    - Improved error handling in `fetchMachines`, `createMachine`, `updateMachine`, `deleteMachine`, and `assignDevice` functions to provide more context from `axios` errors.
    - Added `updateMachine`, `deleteMachine`, and `assignDevice` functions to interact with the backend API.
- **`frontend/src/store/machineStore.ts`:**
    - Simplified the mock data logic in `fetchMachines` to avoid complex merging of mock and real data.
    - Updated `addMachine`, `updateMachine`, `deleteMachine`, and `assignDevice` actions to use the newly implemented `apiService` functions, transitioning from mock implementations to actual API calls.

## 3. Backend Fixes

### 3.1. `go vet` and `staticcheck` Issues

- **`backend/internal/platform/taskqueue/liteq.go`:**
    - **Issue:** `go vet` reported `undefined: liteq.Queue` and `job.Payload undefined`.
    - **Root Cause:** The code was using an incorrect API for the `github.com/khepin/liteq` library version `v0.1.0`. The type should be `liteq.JobQueue`, and the job data field should be `Job`.
    - **Resolution:**
        - Replaced `liteq.Queue` with `liteq.JobQueue` in function signatures.
        - Replaced `job.Payload` (and subsequent incorrect guesses like `job.Message`, `job.Data`, `job.Body`) with `job.Job` to correctly access the job data.
- **`staticcheck`:** Ran `staticcheck` on the main application packages (`cmd`, `edge`, `internal`) and found no issues after the `go vet` fixes.

### 3.2. Configuration and Deployment Consistency

- **`backend/docker-compose.yml`:**
    - **Issue:** Mismatch between `POSTGRES_DB` environment variable (`cnc_monitor_new`) and the database name used in the `postgres` service healthcheck (`cnc_monitor`). This would prevent the `monitor` service from starting.
    - **Resolution:** Changed `POSTGRES_DB` to `cnc_monitor` to align with the healthcheck.
- **`backend/Dockerfile`:**
    - **Issue:** The `EXPOSE` instruction was set to `8080`, but the application's configured port (and `docker-compose.yml` mapping) was `8081`.
    - **Resolution:** Changed `EXPOSE 8080` to `EXPOSE 8081` for consistency.
- **`backend/configs/config.yaml`:
    - **Issue:** The `dbname` was set to `cnc_monitor_new`, which was inconsistent with the corrected `docker-compose.yml` and the database name used by the application.
    - **Resolution:** Changed `dbname` to `cnc_monitor`.
- **`backend/internal/api/handlers.go`:**
    - **Issue:** URL parameter extraction in `GetMachineData` was brittle (`strings.Split`) and error handling returned plain text.
    - **Resolution:**
        - Updated `GetMachineData` to use `r.PathValue("id")` for robust URL parameter extraction (available in Go 1.22+).
        - Modified all API handlers to return JSON error messages instead of plain text, providing more structured error responses.

## 4. Next Steps / Further Improvements

- **Backend `scripts` directory:** The `scripts` directory still contains `go vet` errors related to `main` redeclarations. These are not critical for the main application but should be addressed for overall code hygiene.
- **Frontend `package-lock.json`:** Ensure `package-lock.json` is updated and committed after all frontend dependency changes.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Implement or expand unit/integration tests for the newly integrated API calls in the frontend and the corrected backend logic.
- **Error Reporting Service:** Integrate a proper error reporting service (e.g., Sentry, Bugsnag) for production environments, as noted in `ErrorBoundary.tsx`.
- **DNC Service Integration:** Fully integrate the DNC service with the frontend, moving beyond mock implementations where applicable.
