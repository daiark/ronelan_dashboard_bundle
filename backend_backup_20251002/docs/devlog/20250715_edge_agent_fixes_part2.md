# Devlog: CNC Edge Agent & Backend Ingestion - Debug & Fixes (Part 2)

**Date:** 2025-07-15

## Issues Identified & Fixes Implemented (Continued)

### 4. Data Ingestion Rate Mismatch During Replay

*   **Symptom:** Even after fixing the batched message processing, a noticeable discrepancy persisted between the number of messages replayed by the agent and the number of records actually inserted into the database. This suggested the backend couldn't keep up with the agent's rapid replay.
*   **Root Cause:** The rate limiting implemented in the agent's `replayFile` function (a 50ms delay per 100 lines) was still too fast for the backend's ingestion capabilities, leading to dropped messages or processing delays on the backend side.
*   **Fix:** Increased the delay in `edge/agent/internal/buffering/offline_buffer.go` (`replayFile` function) from 50ms to 100ms per 100 lines. This slows down the agent's replay rate, allowing the backend sufficient time to process and persist each message.

## Current State

*   **Edge Agent Offline Buffering:** The edge agent's offline buffering and replay mechanism is now robust. It correctly detects network outages, buffers data locally, and reliably replays all buffered messages to NATS upon reconnection.
*   **Backend Consumer:** The backend consumer is now capable of correctly processing multiple batched messages received from NATS, ensuring that all data sent by the edge agent is received and processed.
*   **Data Continuity:** With the fixes implemented, data continuity during network outages is significantly improved. The system is designed to prevent data loss by buffering and replaying.
*   **Graceful Shutdown:** The edge agent now handles Ctrl+C signals gracefully, ensuring a clean shutdown without requiring force termination.
*   **Remaining Known Issue:** The backend consumer's ability to automatically re-establish its NATS connection after a prolonged outage was identified as fragile (requiring manual restart in previous tests). While not addressed in code during this session, implementing a robust auto-reconnection mechanism for the backend consumer is a critical next step to enhance overall system resilience.

This concludes the current round of fixes and verification. The system is in a much more stable state regarding data integrity.
