# Data Pipeline Fix Summary

This document summarizes the key issues encountered and the solutions implemented to establish a robust data pipeline from the edge agent to the backend TimescaleDB.

## 1. Initial JSON Unmarshalling Errors (`unexpected end of JSON input`)

*   **Cause:** The edge agent was not correctly framing messages for the backend. Initially, an incorrect attempt was made to add a newline character as a delimiter. The backend was expecting a 4-byte length prefix, not a newline.
*   **Fix:** The edge agent (`edge/agent/internal/buffering/manager.go`) was updated to correctly add a 4-byte Big Endian length prefix to the JSON payload before sending it to NATS. The incorrect newline addition was removed.

## 2. Backend Unmarshalling Errors (`invalid character '\x00'`, `undefined: binary`)

*   **Cause:**
    *   The backend (`internal/ingestion/consumer.go`) was attempting to unmarshal the entire NATS message (including the 4-byte binary length prefix) directly as JSON, leading to `invalid character '\x00'` errors.
    *   A missing `encoding/binary` import in `internal/ingestion/consumer.go` caused build failures.
*   **Fix:**
    *   The backend's NATS consumer (`internal/ingestion/consumer.go`) was updated to first read the 4-byte length prefix, then extract only the subsequent JSON payload for unmarshalling.
    *   The `encoding/binary` package was correctly imported.

## 3. Warm Buffer Errors (`message too short (0 bytes)`)

*   **Cause:**
    *   The `warm_buffer.ReadBatch` function in the edge agent was encountering and returning empty or malformed messages (specifically, messages where the length prefix was 0, resulting in a 4-byte message of all nulls). This was due to reading from uninitialized parts of the memory-mapped file.
    *   The `warm_buffer.ReadBatch` was stripping the length prefix before returning the batch, which caused issues when the NATS client tried to process those messages.
    *   An unused `fmt` import caused a build error.
*   **Fix:**
    *   `edge/agent/internal/buffering/warm_buffer.go` was updated to initialize `writePos` to the actual file size when creating or opening the warm buffer, preventing reads from uninitialized sections.
    *   `ReadBatch` was made more robust to explicitly check for and skip zero-length messages.
    *   Messages read from the warm buffer are now re-prefixed with their length before being added to the batch that is sent to the NATS processor.
    *   The unused `fmt` import was removed.

These changes collectively ensure that data is correctly framed, transmitted, and processed throughout the pipeline.
